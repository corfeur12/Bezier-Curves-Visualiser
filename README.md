# Bezier-Curves-Visualiser
A Python project intended to visualise how Bezier curves work.

## How to use:
Open the Interpolator.py file and use the mouse to interact with nodes on the screen. Use the up/down arrows to cycle between move, create and remove node options.

Note: at present can only delete the last created node.
